A rust script to check if a credit card is valid

## How it works

Best way to get up to speed is to watch this [HaI video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVmE8gcqrg&t=28s), but the short version of it is:

1. Check length to see if it exceeds standard credit card length
2. Check the first 6 digits to see if they match an issued institution
3. Check the check digit that uses Luhn's algorithm
